# Sentimental-Analysis-Using-Neural-Networks
        Sentiment analysis or opinion mining is the computational study of people’s opinions, sentiments, 
    attitudes, and emotions expressed in written language. It is one of the most active research areas in natural 
    language processing and text mining in recent years. Its popularity is mainly due to two reasons.
    
        First, it has a wide range of applications because opinions are central to almost all human activities and
    are key influencers of our behaviors. Whenever we need to make a decision, we want to hear others’ opinions. 
    
        Second, it presents many challenging research problems, which had never been attempted before the year 2000. 
    Part of the reason for the lack of study before was that there was little opinionated text in digital forms. 
    It is thus no surprise that the inception and the rapid growth of the field coincide with those of the social 
    media on the Web.
    
        In fact, the research has also spread outside of computer science to management sciences and social 
    sciences due to its importance to business and society as a whole.
    
        In this talk, I will start with the discussion of the mainstream sentiment analysis research and then
    move on to describe some recent work on modeling comments, discussions, and debates, which represents
    another kind of analysis of sentiments and opinions.

# Conclusion
        Finally, we implemented the recursive neural tensor networks to train a multi-class sentiment analyzer
    The training of standard RNTN was computationally very expensive. This motivated us to introduce the 
    low-rank RNTN. We showed that the low-rank RNTN can achieve comparable accuracies to that of standard RNTN 
    much faster. This better training performance of the low-rank RNTN enables us to train several.
    
        Intelligent systems can be developed which can provide the users with comprehensive reviews of 
    movies, products, services etc. without requiring the user to go through individual reviews, he can
    directly take decisions based on the results provided by the intelligent systems.
